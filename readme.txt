Modification Guide:
For more convenient use, i suggest you follow the modification guide.

Note: I will add this feature on the theme option in next release plus many additions.

MagZine consist of; Main Area, Featured Area (with automated thumbnail generation), and Other Post Archive. You will easily change the default settings from the functions.php file inside the theme folder.

Open functions.php with plain text editor such Notepad, Editplus, BBEdit, or even VIM.

Main Area
Main Area located at the midle of the layout, it has a biger and wider portion of all.
/*MAIN CATEGORY*/
$maincat 	= berita; /*change "berita" into category you want to display */
$maincatid	= 5; /*Category ID*/
$maincatnum = 2; /* Change number "2" into different number, to reflect how many news in main category do display */

How to know your Category ID? Open your wp-admin area, select Post and then Category, you will get your Category ID by click on the category link, and see the number on URL.

Featured Area
Located at the end of Main Area, it has an auto generated thumbnail, all you have to do is just upload an image.
/*FEATURED CATEGORY*/
$featcat	= tutorial;
$featcatid	= 28;
$featcatnum	= 5;
To generate a thumbnail, just upload any images to the related post, you don't have to insert your image into the post if it doesnt necessary, uploading an image is MANDATORY!. Otherwise, you will get an error message:
Warning: array_keys() [function.array-keys]: The first argument should be an array in...

Other Post Archive 
Located at the left of the design, the rest of post category excluding Category on Main Area and Featured Area located here.
/*OTHER POST ARCHIVE*/
$archivenum = 8;

Plugin Recommendation
Though the MagZine theme will running well without this plugin installed, for better experience, i suggest you install the get-image plugin by DGmike:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/get-image/
after the plugins installed, go to wp-admin > setting > media, and change the thumbnail size to: 50 by 50.

Widget Area
This theme got 2 widget area, home widget, and detail widget. Change them on wp-admin > Appearance > Widget.
